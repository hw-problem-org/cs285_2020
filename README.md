>Experimenting with different Deep RL Algorithms in OpenAI Gym

* **Note:** To interact with any notebook as a guest, set the variable GUEST to True present at the beginning.

## Contains:
1. [x] Vanilla Policy Gradient (i.e. REINFORCE Algorithm).
2. [x] Policy Gradient with Causality trick (i.e. "Reward to Go" variance reduction).
3. [x] Policy Gradient with "Average Total Reward" baseline.
4. [x] Policy Gradient with "Reward to Go" and "Average Reward to go" baseline.
5. [ ] Policy Gradient with Advantage Function calculated from a Value Function Critic.
